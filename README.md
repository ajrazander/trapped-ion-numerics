# Ion trapped numerics
 Simulations and calculations useful in controlling trapped ion experiments.


### Sideband Cooling
In trapped ion experiments, we often want to cool the trapped ions to the ground state. This is often done through a technique called resolved sideband cooling (RSC). The simulation package contains the **first** numerical optimization of this technique (along with other methods that are approximately optimal). Feel free to speed up RSC in your lab with this simulation tool. Please cite as: Rasmusson, A.J., et al. "Machine learning estimation of optimal resolved sideband cooling strategies."
